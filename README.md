# Sidewinder X2 Dual 5020 Fan Duct

This is a remix of [this printables model](https://www.printables.com/model/268497-sidewinder-x2-dual-fan-duct)

This fan combination should be quieter than the dual 5015, in addition I've added some screw support to keep the fans in
place without needing so much blue tak.

I haven't yet tested if the extra weight has any noticeable effect on print quality.
